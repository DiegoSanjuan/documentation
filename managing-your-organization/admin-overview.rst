Overview
**************************************

As an administrator for ElasticBox, you get special privileges. You can access to ElasticBox like any other regular user. On top of that, you get an overview of everything users do in your organization. You get to set it up for them to use and control all assets they create in ElasticBox.

The Admin Console is the interface where you manage and control settings for your organization. Access the console from the top right menu of your workspace after you log in to ElasticBox.

The console gives you control in three ways to set up, manage, and monitor:

* **Setup**. The console is where you set up your organization for everyone to use. This includes things like enabling sign-in options, turning on access to cloud providers, tagging instances users launch, integrating to custom IPAM or CMDB solutions using webhooks, and configuring admin boxes.
* **Manage**. The console lets you manage users as well as do things on a large scale. You can not only manage settings across the organization, but get visibility into how others consume assets and provider resources across your organization.
* **Monitor**. Across the organization, the console shows information on how various assets like providers, boxes, instances, and workspaces are being used. You can draw insights based on this information. You can see patterns, trends, and behaviors. This is valuable information to help you make educated decisions to monitor resource usage and improve productivity workflows. That means you can design better ways to bring developers and operations personnel closer together to better deliver applications in your organization.
